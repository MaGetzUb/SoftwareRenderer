This is a software renderer (windows only at the moment) implemented in C++, 
most of the triangle rasterization code is based on TheBennybox' software 
rendering tutorial video series on youtube.

The code isn't very well commented, but the renderer is capable of:
  - Rendering models & clipping triangles
  - Texturing
  - Checkerboard rendering
  - Linear mipmapping
  - Linear texture sampling

To set up the project, open bash, git bash for example run command:
./init.sh

To generate visual studio project run
./generate_project.sh
